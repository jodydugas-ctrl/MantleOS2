# ANCHOR CODING PROMPT
Version: 0.27
Project: SCAN
Purpose: Governing primer for any coding agent working on this project
Anchor set status: A1-A8 remain the active set in v0.27. No governance anchor was added or removed. This revision preserves the Stage 1 architecture contract and frozen holdout while recording Engine v0.20 M6A source-blind reconstruction-trial packaging, static fidelity scoring, and failure attribution under the existing anchors.


## v0.27 M6A blind-reconstruction proof checkpoint

Engine v0.20 adds a reproducible reconstruction experiment boundary without giving a reconstruction agent the original specimen. A verified reconstruction-aware certification is split into a mechanically source-free **public challenge** and a separately sealed **private evaluator**. The public side excludes specimen source bytes, source excerpts, original source paths, `scan_index.sqlite`, evidence catalogs/graphs, and evaluator scoring internals. It does include the source-free mechanical requirements necessary for a fair test: human-facing surface text/type, required binding/effect closure, and MAPPED terminal effect/capability signatures.

The candidate is rescanned rather than source-compared. Static scoring attributes mismatches to `RECONSTRUCTION_AGENT`, `SEMANTIC_IR`, `SCANNER_CANDIDATE_COVERAGE`, or `UNRESOLVED_SOURCE_UNCERTAINTY`, and weak original evidence is never promoted into a strong reconstruction failure. The agent submission is challenge-bound and records whether original source, parent certification, evaluator material, or network source lookup was accessed. Packaging can enforce what is present in the public challenge; external filesystem/network isolation remains a separate harness responsibility and must not be implied merely from an attestation.

These mechanisms implement A2-A4 and support A7-A8: evidence and uncertainty remain mechanically upstream of reconstruction judgment, human surfaces are evaluated as semantic entrances rather than source-code similarity, and NEST/effect expectations remain explicit. A1 is preserved because M6A performs static scanning of the reconstructed candidate; it does not execute or stimulate either the original specimen or the surrogate. Runtime M6B evaluation, if later authorized, remains a separate experimental mode.

M6A is a mechanism pass, not a full PR7 pass. A production-grade reconstruction proof still requires a capable external coding agent that has not seen the original source, plus behavior-level evaluation on complete calibrated specimen evidence. No ninth anchor is added.

## v0.26 reconstruction-promotion and immutable-lineage checkpoint

Engine v0.19 implements the first M5 semantic-promotion gate. Human or LLM semantic generation remains downstream of the mechanical scan and has no authority to write unsupported meaning directly into the canonical graph. A reconstruction proposal is validated mechanically before promotion: promoted semantic claims must reach first-class evidence; reconstruction anchors require typed behavior/artery/nerve/capability support; MAPPED anchors may not depend on weaker PARTIAL/BLOCKED/UNKNOWN support or visible contradictions; and rejected proposals leave the canonical graph unchanged.

Promoted behavior contracts and Reconstruction Anchors remain derived objects under A4. They do not become DIRECT evidence merely because an LLM or human proposed them or because SCAN accepted their proof structure. `reconstruction_contract.json` is a projection of canonical IDs and proof paths, not a new authority.

Engine v0.19 also establishes immutable read semantics for sealed handoffs. Read-only queries and evidence inspection use SQLite immutable mode so ordinary `query`, `why`, `impact`, object/audit/closure inspection, and certification verification do not create WAL/SHM sidecars or mutate sealed database bytes. Reconstruction-aware certification is a child lineage: the parent mechanical certification remains unchanged and is referenced by SHA-256 in the derived receipt.

These mechanisms implement A2-A4 and strengthen A7-A8 without adding a ninth anchor. They reduce the chance that a future agent will confuse interpretation with measurement or mutate evidence merely by inspecting it.


## v0.25 agent-handoff certification checkpoint

Engine v0.18 adds sealed local and manifest-backed specimen-certification protocols for downstream agents. Certification verifies release bytes, runs the ordinary local scan with common LLM credentials removed, executes canonical integrity/projection/query gates, records the specimen fingerprint, provider/repository/commit/tree identity when available, and scan policy, seals every emitted artifact in a certification manifest, and supports independent re-verification after transfer.

A certification `PASS` is deliberately a **mechanical-integrity claim about the evidence handoff**, not a semantic-completeness claim about the specimen. `MAPPED`, `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, `UNKNOWN`, parser gaps, acquisition gaps, and budget stops remain independent evidence that the consuming agent must inspect. This distinction directly preserves A2-A4, A7, and A8: valid evidence must not be inflated into capabilities or behaviors that the scan has not established.

The certification bundle contains scanner-owned evidence products and receipts rather than silently copying specimen source. Ordinary certification remains read-only with respect to the specimen.

## v0.24 production-hardening checkpoint

Engine v0.15 extends mechanically traceable Qt async/event closure without weakening UNKNOWN/PARTIAL semantics. Engines v0.16-v0.17 then harden bounded execution, cancellation, derived-store corruption/rebuild behavior, package/projection self-audit, an LLM-disabled qualification/query gate, parser/adaptor failure isolation, resume-after-budget behavior, and wheel-based deployment. These are implementations of A1-A4, A7, and A8; they add no ninth anchor and do not promote blocked NotepadNext or frozen-holdout evidence into completed calibration.

A local parser/adaptor exception must become explicit affected-region evidence rather than erase the rest of the visible body. Conversely, catastrophic process-level conditions such as `MemoryError` must not be mislabeled as ordinary PARTIAL parser coverage. Release qualification remains subordinate to specimen calibration and reconstruction proof.

## v0.21 hardening checkpoint

Engine v0.14 begins release hardening at the source-byte boundary. Local and manifest scans must not obtain extra capability by following symbolic links, reading special files, accepting traversal paths, or silently consuming specimen bytes that changed after census. Resource ceilings must produce explicit coverage states rather than quiet omission. These are implementations of existing anchors, especially A1-A4; they do not add new product semantics.

## v0.20 directive integration

The project-wide **Scanner Architecture and Stage 1 Implementation Directive** is now an explicit implementation contract for SCAN. It does not add a ninth governance anchor. Instead it sharpens how A2, A3, A4, A7, and A8 are implemented:

- repeated discovery work belongs in reusable scanner code, not disposable LLM passes;
- Stage 1 discovery/census/extraction must be able to operate without an LLM for supported substrates;
- the Machine Body Map must compress fine-grained evidence into higher-order anatomy without discarding drill-down provenance;
- repository scale is an engineering/indexing/caching problem rather than an LLM-context problem;
- LLM reasoning begins after the mechanical evidence substrate exists and receives selected evidence, graph neighborhoods, anomalies, and unresolved seams;
- unsupported or unresolved regions remain explicit `UNKNOWN`, `PARTIAL`, or `BLOCKED`.

This directive is subordinate to A1-A8 and must not be used to weaken them.

## Read this first

You are being given a software engineering problem with **anchors**.

An anchor is a property, behavior, boundary, or meaning that the owner requires the finished system to preserve.

Anchors are **properties that are not available for optimization away**.

You have broad engineering freedom inside those boundaries. You may redesign architecture, replace algorithms, change libraries, reorganize files, simplify mechanisms, combine components, invent new approaches, or produce a solution unlike anything a human designer would have proposed. Use your strongest technical judgment.

However, every active anchor must still be true in the **end product**.

A change is not an improvement if it makes an active anchor false, weaker, unreliable, accidental, or dependent on an unstated assumption, even if the change makes the system faster, smaller, cleaner, more elegant, more conventional, or easier to maintain.

Examples, prototypes, previous implementations, and suggested algorithms are evidence about intent. They are not automatically mandatory architectures. You may replace them when you have a better solution, provided the replacement preserves the anchors.

If you believe two anchors conflict, or an anchor prevents a materially better solution, do not silently weaken it. Preserve the current anchor state and report the conflict precisely.

At meaningful integration points and again before final delivery, perform an **Anchor Gate**:

1. List every active anchor.
2. State how the current implementation satisfies it.
3. Point to objective evidence or a test where practical.
4. Mark any unresolved case explicitly.
5. Do not call the build complete while an active anchor is knowingly false.

Implementation may evolve freely. Anchored properties may not.

## Two anchor namespaces in SCAN

This project uses the same anchor concept in two distinct places. Do not mix them.

**SCAN Governance Anchors** govern the scanner itself. They define properties that the SCAN implementation must preserve regardless of how the scanner is redesigned. The active anchors below are governance anchors.

**Specimen Reconstruction Anchors** are downstream findings derived from a completed or sufficiently supported software scan. They describe properties and behaviors of the scanned specimen that a future coding agent must preserve if asked to recreate that application.

Both kinds of anchors are properties that are not available for optimization away, but reconstruction anchors must be traceable to specimen evidence and must never overwrite the underlying scan evidence from which they were derived.

A reconstruction agent may use radically different internals when recreating a specimen unless an internal property is itself anchored. The test is fidelity to the anchored behavior and meaning, not imitation of the original source code.

SCAN is **not** an AppAI birth, migration, or resident-assimilation system. AppAI and NEST examples may teach useful scanning principles, but the purpose of this project is different: examine software deeply enough that its human control surfaces, effective abilities, lifecycle, hidden or unusual behaviors, and important internal pathways can be reconstructed with the highest fidelity the evidence supports.

The reconstruction target is therefore stronger than a feature list. If the specimen contains an obscure, undocumented, conditionally reachable, or easter-egg-like behavior, that behavior is part of the organism when the evidence supports it and must not be optimized out merely because documentation ignores it.

# ACTIVE SCAN ANCHORS

## A1. Preserve the specimen

Ordinary SCAN operation is read-only and non-destructive.

The scanner may read and analyze repository source, metadata, build definitions, resources, and other exposed artifacts, but it must not modify, instrument, execute, rewrite, configure, or otherwise alter the specimen merely to understand it.

Any execution, instrumentation, stimulation, build, runtime observation, or behavior-probing capability beyond ordinary static analysis is a separate explicitly authorized mode.

SCAN may deepen across multiple passes. If the operator explicitly authorizes a deeper experimental mode, the scanner may work on isolated copies, construct scanner-owned test harnesses, recreate minimal code fragments, compile reconstructed fragments, or stimulate a controlled copy to test a specific hypothesis. Such work must remain outside the canonical pinned specimen, must preserve provenance, and must clearly distinguish reconstructed experimental code from original specimen code.

The exact specimen must be identifiable using repository identity plus a commit, tree hash, content fingerprint, or equivalent stable source anchor.


**Acquisition evidence is separate from parsing evidence.** A repository provider may expose that a path or object exists without making the corresponding bytes available to the scanner runtime. SCAN must preserve that distinction. Provider-visible metadata may establish path identity, revision identity, object IDs, declared sizes, or tree membership, but content-level parsing requires verified bytes. A transport or acquisition failure must be recorded as an acquisition gap and must never be mislabeled as parser failure, source absence, or successful content coverage.

## A2. Scanning engine discovers; AI interprets

SCAN is a **scanning engine first and an LLM reasoning system second**. The scanner must use deterministic code whenever practical to discover, enumerate, parse, measure, classify, trace, connect, compare, compress, and map software.

LLMs must not be required for ordinary structural scanning when conventional code can do the work. Repository enumeration, source indexing, symbol extraction, registration discovery, graph construction, UI/action census, handler discovery, boundary detection, and similar repeatable operations belong in reusable scanner software rather than one-off LLM reading passes.

Whenever a scan operation is likely to recur, preserve it as part of the SCAN product: a reusable module, parser/adapter, index, graph operation, cache, query, or command-line capability. SCAN itself should improve as specimens expose weaknesses. Disposable scripts are not the target architecture.

The common Machine Body Map should remain language-agnostic at the model level while extraction remains language- and framework-aware. Use the strongest practical substrate-specific adapters and normalize their evidence into common anatomical concepts where reasonable. Do not force different ecosystems into identical parsing techniques.

The deterministic layer should establish, as far as available evidence permits:

- what exists,
- where it exists,
- how structures connect,
- what flows through those connections,
- what loops or recurring pathways exist,
- what externally visible surfaces exist,
- what lifecycle states and state transitions exist,
- what observable behaviors those transitions produce,
- and where observation is possible.

AI may later interpret the resulting evidence to explain probable purpose, role, larger function, behavior equivalence, reconstruction meaning, or useful experiments. The LLM should normally receive selected evidence, graph neighborhoods, anomalies, unresolved seams, and compressed summaries rather than being asked to reread an entire large repository.

AI interpretation must remain distinguishable from directly observed or measured evidence and must never silently fill missing evidence with confident prose. Never spend LLM reasoning on a question that reliable code can cheaply answer at scale.

## A3. Account for the whole visible body

SCAN must attempt to account for the entire software body visible in the supplied specimen, not merely files or functions matching expected names.

Relevant files and meaningful structures must receive an explicit coverage state such as:

- MAPPED
- PARTIAL
- BLOCKED
- NOT_APPLICABLE
- UNKNOWN

A parser failure, unsupported language, generated source, unusually large artifact, obfuscation, or other blind spot must become visible coverage evidence, not an invisible omission.

Undocumented, unusual, dormant, obsolete, conditionally reachable, apparently unreachable, or poorly named code must remain discoverable in the body map when it is present in the available specimen.

Coverage is progressive and resumable. A shallow pass may legitimately leave regions PARTIAL or UNKNOWN; later passes may spend more time, use stronger analysis, or enter separately authorized experimental modes to refine them. Deeper evidence must refine, qualify, or explicitly supersede earlier findings rather than silently erasing them. A limited time or depth budget is never permission to pretend the unscanned remainder does not exist.

Repository scale must be treated as an engineering problem, not an LLM-context problem. The scanner should be designed for incremental indexing, content hashing, extraction caching, dependency-aware invalidation where practical, stable IDs, normalized graph storage, parallelizable extraction, resumable scans, queryable evidence, and targeted deepening. Fine-grained evidence stays available for drill-down while higher-order structures compress it for human and AI reasoning.


Acquisition coverage must also scale mechanically. The Machine Body Map should distinguish at least provider-visible objects, materialized bytes, verified content digests, parser eligibility, and parser results. A file that is known to exist but whose bytes are unavailable remains accounted for with explicit PARTIAL or BLOCKED acquisition state. It must not disappear from the body simply because a connector or transport cannot materialize it.

**Completeness is a vector, not a single score.** SCAN must preserve coverage across meaningful anatomical dimensions and subdimensions. A global percentage may be shown only as optional convenience and must never replace, hide, average away, or overrule explicit `MAPPED`, `PARTIAL`, `BLOCKED`, `NOT_APPLICABLE`, and `UNKNOWN` states. The operator must be able to see *where* the body remains uncertain.

## A4. Implementation evidence outranks description

SCAN reconstructs the software entity evidenced by implementation.

Documentation, comments, identifiers, README files, issue text, and developer descriptions are useful evidence but do not define what the application actually contains or can do.

Structural evidence such as symbols, call relationships, references, event connections, loops, state transitions, build topology, resources, and entry points must be preserved independently of semantic descriptions.

Important conclusions must retain traceable source evidence so a later human or AI can return to the specimen.

**Evidence must be a first-class machine object, not merely a label such as `DIRECT`.** When exact source evidence is available, a claim should retain a stable evidence identity, source artifact identity, source location, extractor/procedure identity, evidence class, and enough provenance to reproduce or audit the extraction. Semantic objects and relationships must refer to these evidence objects explicitly.

The dependency from evidence to meaning must be mechanically traversable. A supported reconstruction property should be able to walk backward through its behaviors, pathways, interpretations, and graph relations to the exact source evidence that justifies it. The inverse dependency should also be queryable so SCAN can determine what interpretations or reconstruction anchors are affected when evidence changes or is contradicted.

When SCAN derives a behavior specification or Specimen Reconstruction Anchor Map, every derived property must remain traceable to the evidence and uncertainty that support it. Derived anchors summarize what must remain true in a recreation; they do not become a replacement authority for the original scan. Contradictory later evidence must be preserved and propagated as uncertainty or supersession rather than silently deleting the earlier proof chain.

When an unexplained structure appears important, SCAN should preserve it first and then pursue its purpose as deeply as the authorized scan depth allows. A strange function does not become irrelevant because its name is opaque, its route is rare, or documentation is silent. If purpose cannot yet be supported, preserve the structure and mark the purpose UNKNOWN rather than flattening it into a familiar feature.

## A5. Biology is an analytical model, not a costume

SCAN should consider what a software project resembles biologically when that viewpoint exposes useful organization, relationships, flows, regulation, boundaries, or behavior.

Biological classifications must be earned from software evidence. Do not force every program into a fixed organ list.

If the evidence does not justify a biological classification, preserve the underlying software structure without inventing one.

The biological model exists to improve analysis, not for roleplay.

## A6. Map circulation and its nerves

Recurring or high-importance pathways carrying control, events, data, state, messages, work, or other significant activity form the candidate circulatory system.

SCAN must seek and map major **arteries**.

An artery is a significant pathway through which software activity flows. Major loops, dispatch paths, event systems, callback chains, queues, state pipelines, message routes, lifecycle paths, or comparable structures may be arteries when supported by evidence.

For each major artery, determine as much as practical about:

- origin,
- route,
- loops,
- participating functions or structures,
- junctions,
- destinations or effects,
- dependencies,
- and relationships with other arteries.

A **nerve-access point** is not an artery. It is a location where an observer could non-destructively sense meaningful activity on an artery.

The scanner must identify candidate nerve-access points without inserting them during ordinary SCAN operation.

Where practical, characterize candidate nerves by:

- what they can sense,
- artery or pathway observed,
- direction of information,
- pathway coverage,
- reliability,
- invasiveness,
- implementation difficulty,
- and known blind spots.

A major artery with no safe observation point is still an important finding and must be reported.

## A7. Map the complete human interaction surface

SCAN must attempt to discover and map every interface through which a human can perceive, invoke, control, or otherwise interact with the software entity.

Every reachable user action should be traceable from its human-facing affordance through the event or command machinery into its internal implementation, resulting state change or external effect, and observable feedback whenever the available evidence permits.

The map must account for alternate routes to the same behavior and for surfaces that are conditional, dynamic, indirect, platform-specific, or helper-mediated. Applicable surfaces may include windows, menus, menu items, toolbars, buttons, editor regions, tabs, dialogs, context menus, keyboard shortcuts, mouse or touch gestures, drag-and-drop targets, file associations, command-line inputs, operating-system events, accessibility actions, and other human-accessible controls exposed by the specimen.

Each mapped user behavior should retain stable references to:

- the human-facing surface or affordance,
- the user action or gesture,
- visibility and enablement conditions,
- alternate human routes to the same semantic behavior,
- the event, signal, command, callback, or dispatch boundary,
- the internal pathway and significant arteries reached,
- resulting state changes or external effects,
- observable feedback returned to the human,
- and candidate nerve-access points.

Where practical, SCAN should distinguish:

- **sensory / afferent nerve candidates**, where a future observer could determine what happened or what state the application is in; and
- **motor / efferent nerve candidates**, where a separately authorized future agent could invoke the same semantic capability available to a human.

Ordinary SCAN identifies these candidate points but does not activate, instrument, stimulate, or modify them.

A human capability must not disappear from the scan merely because its implementation is indirect, dynamically connected, routed through helper functions, reachable by multiple interface paths, or implemented by framework machinery.

The target completeness question is: for every action a human can perform through the application interface, can the scan identify where that action enters the software, what pathway it follows, what it changes or causes, what the human can observe afterward, and where a future authorized agent could observe or reproduce the same semantic action?

## A8. Map the NEST and effective capability boundary

Software capability is not determined by specimen code alone. SCAN must attempt to identify the relevant **NEST**: the operating environment, host substrate, runtime, framework, device, service, repository platform, installed toolset, filesystem, permission model, extension system, or other external ecology that materially supplies, constrains, exposes, or changes what the specimen can sense or do.

The scanner must distinguish, where evidence permits:

- **intrinsic capability**: primarily implemented inside the specimen body,
- **borrowed capability**: primarily supplied by the NEST,
- **coupled capability**: requires a body pathway plus a particular NEST facility,
- **potential capability**: a NEST facility exists but no supported body coupling has been established,
- **blocked capability**: a pathway exists but permission, configuration, availability, or another condition prevents use,
- **unknown capability**: evidence is insufficient.

For relevant body-to-NEST couplings, preserve the provider, boundary/interface, direction, permissions or guards, body entry/exit seam, resulting effect, and candidate sensory or motor nerve points.

The scanner must not confuse environmental possibility with demonstrated software ability. **NEST HAS FEATURE** does not by itself mean **BODY CAN USE FEATURE**, **BODY IS AUTHORIZED TO USE FEATURE**, **BODY CURRENTLY USES FEATURE**, or **FEATURE HAS BEEN OBSERVED WORKING**.

Extension and add-on systems are part of this boundary. When a specimen can accept new add-ons, commands, plugins, tools, scripts, handlers, or other externally supplied behavior, SCAN should map the extension receptors and contracts even when no particular extension is installed. Distinguish actual attached anatomy from latent attachment points that could grow new surfaces or capabilities.

A faithful recreation may use a different environmental mechanism when its reconstruction anchors allow that freedom, but the original scan must preserve where the specimen's effective abilities actually came from.

---

# REQUIRED PRODUCT SHAPE

A completed SCAN should preserve two complementary representations.

## Machine Body Map

A deterministic structured representation of the examination, including enough evidence to reconstruct and query the scan. The **canonical authority should be one normalized evidence/body graph or equivalent database**, with readable JSON maps treated as projections of that shared object identity rather than independent descriptions that can drift apart. It should preserve, when applicable:

- specimen provenance and fingerprint,
- acquisition provenance, provider object identity, byte-availability state, and verified content-digest state,
- scanner/adapter versions and extraction provenance,
- stable globally unique machine identities for files, symbols, surfaces, edges, evidence, findings, behaviors, arteries, nerves, capabilities, interpretations, and reconstruction anchors,
- incremental/content-hash cache metadata,
- first-class evidence objects with source locations and extractor provenance,
- typed cross-object relations such as `supports`, `derived_from`, `contradicts`, `enters`, `observed_by`, `requires`, and `supports_anchor`,
- a queryable index that can answer mechanical coverage and provenance questions without an LLM rereading the repository,
- multidimensional completeness vectors and nested coverage dimensions rather than one authoritative completion percentage,
- file coverage,
- language and build census,
- symbol inventory,
- module/dependency graph,
- call graph,
- event/signal graph,
- loop inventory,
- state or data-flow evidence,
- external surfaces,
- human interaction / affordance map,
- behavior-equivalence groups for alternate human routes,
- user action -> event -> handler -> effect -> feedback paths,
- NEST/ecosystem inventory where relevant,
- body <-> NEST capability-coupling graph,
- intrinsic / borrowed / coupled / potential / blocked capability states,
- scan-depth, experiment, and evidence-supersession provenance,
- artery map,
- candidate nerve map,
- unusual or weakly explained structures,
- parser limitations,
- and explicit unknowns.

The exact serialization is an engineering choice, but the representation must support machine queries, graph traversal, evidence drill-down, dependency analysis, and projection export at scale. The current preferred shape is a normalized database plus exported JSON projections. Friendly body, artery, nerve, control-surface, NEST, and reconstruction views must retain canonical IDs and explicit cross-references to the same underlying graph.

A certification-grade reconstruction anchor should therefore answer both **"why does this anchor exist?"** and **"what changes if this evidence is invalidated?"** through mechanical traversal rather than prose matching.

## Human Body Scan Report

A readable report derived from the Machine Body Map explaining:

- what the software entity contains,
- how its major systems appear to work,
- what flows through it,
- the major arteries,
- candidate observation nerves,
- unusual, hidden, dormant, or weakly documented structures,
- confidence and evidence type,
- and what remains unknown.

The readable report must not replace the underlying machine evidence.

## Secondary derived products

The primary purpose of SCAN is to scan and preserve evidence about software. After that evidence exists, downstream tools may derive additional products such as:

- a lifecycle state model,
- a behavior contract map,
- a capability map,
- a NEST/capability-coupling map,
- a Control Surface & Capability Reconstruction Map,
- a Specimen Reconstruction Anchor Map,
- or a recreation brief for a coding agent.

These are secondary products. They must be generated from the preserved scan, remain traceable to it, retain uncertainty, and never narrow the underlying body map merely to make recreation easier.

The reconstruction objective is maximum evidence-supported fidelity to the specimen's control surfaces and effective abilities, including obscure, undocumented, dynamic, extension-provided, and easter-egg-like behavior when discovered. A recreation does not need source-level similarity unless source compatibility or a specific internal mechanism is itself required.

A Specimen Reconstruction Anchor should describe a property that a faithful recreation must keep true. It should prefer observable behavior and essential semantics over incidental implementation details unless the implementation detail itself is functionally significant.

---

# EVIDENCE DISCIPLINE

Use explicit evidence classes when useful:

- DIRECT: directly present in source or repository structure.
- MEASURED: produced by deterministic analysis or tooling.
- REPORTED: stated by documentation or another source.
- INFERRED: interpretation derived from evidence.
- ASSUMED: working assumption not yet verified.
- UNKNOWN: evidence does not currently support an answer.

Confidence is not evidence.

Absence from scanner output is not proof of absence unless the relevant region has sufficient coverage to support that conclusion.

---

# FINAL INSTRUCTION TO THE CODING AGENT

Do your best engineering work.

You are not required to imitate previous code, conventional architecture, or a human-preferred implementation style. Creative solutions are welcome.

But before declaring success, prove that every active anchor still holds true in the final product.

When deciding whether new work belongs in scanner code or an LLM prompt, use this implementation rule: if a fact can be extracted, counted, traversed, matched, indexed, measured, classified, or conservatively inferred by reusable software at scale, build or extend the scanner. Reserve the LLM for semantic interpretation, purpose inference, architectural judgment, hypothesis formation, behavior explanation, uncertainty resolution, and experimental design.

**The implementation is free to evolve. The anchored properties are not.**
